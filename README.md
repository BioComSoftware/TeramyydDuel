Teramyyd — Air-to-Air Combat (Unity prototype)

Overview

This workspace contains an initial scaffold for the Teramyyd air-to-air combat game using Unity and C#.

What I added

- Assets/Scripts: starter MonoBehaviour scripts (PlayerAircraft, EnemyAircraft, Projectile, GameManager, InputManager)
- Docs: design overview, prompt placeholder

Next steps

1. Open this folder as a Unity project (Unity 2020.3 LTS or newer recommended).
2. Create a Scene (e.g., Main.unity) and add a Player GameObject with the `PlayerAircraft` script attached.
3. Create projectile and enemy prefabs in `Assets/Prefabs` and wire them to the scripts.
4. Iterate on controls and AI in the scripts under `Assets/Scripts`.

Prompt placeholder

Please paste the original doc prompt into `Docs/Prompt.txt` so I can use it directly to flesh out design and implementation details.

Notes

This is an initial, minimal scaffold intended to be safe and fast to iterate on. After you paste the original prompt I will continue implementing game-specific features, tests, and prefabs as requested.
